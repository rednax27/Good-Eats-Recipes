               "Two words: honey salmon! Sure, it takes a tiny bit of prep work, but once you marinate your salmon, you won’t be able to go back. A simple mix of honey, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger coats and flavors your fish for 30 minutes before you throw it on the pan until the outside is perfectly crispy. Once that’s done, you heat up and reduce some extra marinade to make a thick, to-die-for glaze to pour over your filet. Serve with your favorite veggies or rice and enjoy!"
